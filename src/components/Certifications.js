      "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification is the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, authorized by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University and offered through Coursera, instructed by Andrew Ng. The course covers core supervised learning concepts including linear regression, logistic regression, and gradient descent, along with regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Learners implement these algorithms hands-on using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn, building a strong practical foundation alongside the theory. It is one of the most well-regarded entry-level ML courses available, designed to bridge the gap between mathematical intuition and real-world application.",
